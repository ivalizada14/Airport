# dbms
This is a project that I developed in the course Database Management Systems at the university.

Here I created a database model "Airport" which contains entities typical to an airport such as "Flight", "Airline", "Passenger". I worked on the taks like writing SQL & PL/SQL queries, creating data strucures, and so on.

It contains one .sql file and pictures of the database model.

I designed the db model using PowerDesiger, and wrote the sql code on Oracle SQL Developer.
